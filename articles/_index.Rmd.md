Looking at the evolution of video game consoles is fascinating. While conventional PCs tend to evolve 'incrementally', new generations of consoles introduce completely new ways of working. What you see here is a series of articles aimed at uncovering the rationale behind the latest trends in technology. They will also demonstrate why each system can't be summarised by its 'bits', megahertz, amount of RAM and whatnot.

This is not a developer manual, just an *in-depth* introduction to how each system works internally. Bear in mind that tech has gotten really complicated lately, so if you struggle to follow my latest articles, try reading the early ones first. They introduce many concepts and definitions that are constantly revisited.

Basic knowledge of computing is preferable, however, I try really hard to adapt my content for wider audiences, so please don't be afraid to give it a try! But if that's not enough, you may want to look at the [supporting readings](readings).

While I try to be as accurate as possible, if you find any mistakes please [give me a shout](https://github.com/flipacholas/Architecture-of-consoles). Finally, if you prefer reading offline, check out the [multiple book editions](book).

Without further ado, here they are!
