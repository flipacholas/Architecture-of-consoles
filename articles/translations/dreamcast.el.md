## Introduction

The Sega Dreamcast introduced many new features over its predecessor the [Saturn]({{< ref "sega-saturn" >}}) to appeal to both game developers and console gamers. While this was Sega's last attempt to conquer the console market, some of the technologies which were pioneered in the Dreamcast carried on and into future mainstream devices.

---

## CPU

Unsurprisingly Sega again chose Hitachi to develop their CPU. If you've been reading the [previous article about the Sega Saturn]({{< ref "sega-saturn" >}}) then, lo and behold, I present you the next generation of SH processor: the **SH-4** running at a whopping **200 MHz**. So, what's interesting about this CPU?

- **5-stage pipeline**: Up to five instructions can be in flight simultaneously (a detailed explanation can be found in a [previous article]({{% ref)).
  - Instruction pipelining is now found everywhere in this generation of consoles and will be standard from now on.
- **2-way superscalar**: A new type of parallelism where the CPU can process more than one instruction (two in this case) in each stage of the pipeline resulting in more instructions executed per second.
- A dedicated **Floating-Point Unit** or 'FPU': Computes 32-bit decimal numbers (the *floats*) and 64-bit ones (the *doubles*).
- 8 KB **instruction cache** and 16 KB **data cache**: This ratio is rather curious since consoles tend to include more instruction cache than data cache. However, the SH-4 allows the data cache to be split into two sections: 8 KB of *Scratchpad* (fast RAM) and 8 KB of data cache.
- **32-bit internal architecture** while keeping a **16-bit instruction set** (the SuperH ISA): Just like the SH-2, this increases code density and decreases bus overheads while still enjoying the advantages of a 32-bit architecture.
- **External 64-bit bus**: Critical for manipulating 64-bit values (e.g. doubles and longs) without wasting extra cycles.

#### Extra work

The common chores of a game console CPU include handling a game's logic, running the enemy AI and keeping the GPU fed with instructions. In the Dreamcast the SH-4 is also involved in the majority of the graphics pipeline, processing geometry data such as computing perspective transformations. As a result, it includes a **128-bit SIMD** unit that can accelerate vector operations.

#### Improving memory access

The CPU includes a dedicated **Memory Management Unit** or 'MMU' for virtual addressing, this is helpful since the physical memory address space of this CPU happens to be **29 bits wide**. So with the help of four TLBs, programmers can use 32-bit addresses without hitting performance penalties.

Since only 29 bits are needed for addressing, the extra three bits control memory protection, alternating the memory map and circumventing the cache, respectively.

The programmer decides whether to use these features or not. Games for this system certainly don't necessarily _need_ memory protection and the MMU has to be manually enabled at boot.

#### No UMA but...

While this system is not designed around the strict Unified Memory Architecture like a [}}#simplified-memory-access">well-known competitor]({{< ref), it does delegate I/O access to the GPU. That means that if the CPU has to fetch anything that's beyond its own dedicated RAM or a serial interface which is also connected too, it will have to request the GPU (and wait if necessary).

#### Special queries

This CPU also features a unique functionality called **Parallel I/O** or 'PIO' that is used to manipulate multiple I/O locations at the same time. Sega wired up these pins so the CPU can manipulate the GPU's **video mode** (more details about this later).

---

## Graphics

The GPU package is a custom-made chip called **Holly** running at 100 MHz, it's designed by VideoLogic (now known as Imagination Technologies) and manufactured by NEC. Holly's 3D core happens to be Videologic's **PowerVR2** (also called 'PowerVR Series2' and 'CLX2').

{{< /float_block >}}

{{% inner_markdown %}}
VideoLogic chose an alternative approach for the construction of their 3D engine called **Tile-Based Deferred Rendering** or 'TBDR'. TBDR, instead of rendering a whole frame at once, as traditional **Immediate Mode Renderers** or 'IMR' do, divides the rendering area into multiple sections called 'tiles'. It carries out the rendering process on each tile individually then the result is combined to draw the final frame.  This innovative design brings interesting advantages:
- It can be greatly **parallelised**, which significantly reduces bandwidth and power usage.
- It implements a clever solution to the [}}#an-introduction-to-the-visibility-problem">**visibility problem**]({{< ref) by automatically sorting the polygons **from front to back** and then performing [}}#modern-visible-surface-determination">z-tests]({{< ref) at the first stages of the pipeline. The combination of these tasks not only solves the original problem, but it also **prevents overdraw** (rasterisation of hidden polygons) which wastes resources, degrading performance.

It's no surprise that Imagination took this efficient technology forward to build the Series 4 PowerVR cores which powered an incredible number of devices, including the first generation of iPhone, the iPhone 3G, the Nokia N95 and the Dell Axim x51.

#### Architecture

Let's take a look at the two main components of the Dreamcast's GPU:

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab active="true" name="Tile Accelerator" >}}

{{< float_block >}}
  {{< linked_img src="tile_accelerator.png" alt="Tile Accelerator Diagram" >}} <figcaption class="caption">Architecture of the Tile Accelerator</figcaption>
{{< /float_block >}}

{{% inner_markdown %}}
Before the rendering process starts a component known as the **Tile Accelerator** performs pre-processing. It starts by allocating several 32x32 tile bins into which the geometry will be rendered.

Then the Tile Accelerator will:

1. Grab the geometry data and drawing commands issued by the CPU (either using DMA or traditional transfers).
2. Compile this data into an **internal format**.
3. Distribute the geometry to each bin based on its coordinates. Clipped geometry will be discarded as well.
4. Generate the resulting Display Lists.

These Display Lists will be interpreted by the 3D engine.
{{% /inner_markdown %}}

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="PowerVR2 Core" >}}

{{< float_block >}}
  {{< linked_img src="powervr2.png" alt="PowerVR2 Core Diagram" >}} <figcaption class="caption">Architecture of the PowerVR2 Core</figcaption>
{{< /float_block >}}

{{% inner_markdown %}}
Here is where the graphics are brought into life, the Display Lists received from the TA will be used to render the geometry of a single tile using an **internal frame-buffer**. The process is as follows:

1. The **Image Synthesis Processor** or 'ISP' fetches the primitives (either triangles or quads) and performs **Hidden-Surface Removal** to remove unseen polygons. Then, after calculating its Z-buffers and stencil buffers, the data goes through **Depth Testing** to avoid rendering polygons that would appear behind others and **Stencil Tests** to cull geometry that won't be visible if they are located behind a 2D polygon (also called **Mask**).
    - Notice how these tests are effectively carried out at the start of the pipeline. In contrast previous consoles [}}#modern-visible-surface-determination">using z-buffers]({{< ref) discard the geometry at the end of the pipeline. The ISP approach prevents processing the geometry that will eventually be discarded, thereby saving resources.
2. The **Texture and Shading Processor** or 'TSP' applies colouring and shading over the tile area. It also provides multiple effects (more details later on).
    - Textures are not applied until the tile is exported, meaning that emerging overdraw (if any) will not lower the fill rate.

After the operation is completed, the rendered tile is written to the main frame-buffer in VRAM. This process is repeated until all tiles are finished. Once complete the resulting frame-buffer is picked by the **Video encoder** and sent through the video signal.

#### The big picture

Apart from the clear architectural difference, the Texture and Shading Processor comes with many capabilities that give one an idea of how distant this console is from the old [Saturn]({{< ref "sega-saturn">}}). Here are a few:

- **Alpha blending**: Combines colours of overlapping layers to achieve transparency effects.
  - The process used for applying transparency in this system is called **order-independent transparency**. The algorithm automatically sorts the primitives before blending their colours, and while this slows down the rendering process, it avoids relying on the game itself to do all the sorting manually. For this reason, Dreamcast games excelled in displaying transparent objects.
  - Combined with the tile-based system, order-independent transparency completely addresses previous [}}#the-transparency-issue">mishaps]({{< ref).
- **Mip-Mapping**: Automatically selects a scaled-down version of the texture depending on the level of detail required. This is done to prevent processing large textures that would be seen far away from the camera (which would be a waste of processing power and produce aliasing).
- **Environment mapping**: Applies reflections on textures.
- **Bilinear, Trilinear and anisotropic filtering**: These are different algorithms used to smooth the textures and prevent pixelation. They are ordered from 'worst' to 'best', where the resulting quality of each one is directly proportional to the amount of computation required.
  - This is a huge step up from the Saturn since the former didn't provide any texture filter!
- **Bump mapping**: Simulates defects on surfaces without spending extra polygons.

#### Gaining detail

Holly can now draw ~10 times more polygons than [its predecessor]({{< ref "sega-saturn">}}), here's a *Before & After* example that shows how model designs are not that limited any more. Try to fiddle with them!

    <figcaption class="caption">Sonic Adventure (1999) for the Dreamcast
    <br>1001 triangles</figcaption>
  </div>
{{< /side_by_side >}}

#### Video Modes

The video system was designed to support multiple types of screens and formats, thus the video encoder outputs to a single-shaped socket that supports the following type of signals:

- **Composite**: Combines the three signals needed to display video (chroma, luma and sync) into a single one, requiring only a single-pin cable.
  - This is used on old PAL and NTSC TVs with an RCA connection.
- **S-Video**: Combines luma and sync while keeping chroma separated (two video lines in total).
- **RGB**: Sends separate Red-Green-Blue signals and provides different sync types to choose from (composite sync or extracted from video composite or S-Video).
  - A SCART cable will use this type.
- **VGA**: Combines RGB with two special sync signals (horizontal and vertical) resulting in five video lines in total. This enables to display the biggest resolution possible (720x480) in progressive mode (thus, this mode is often named '480p'). VGA has actually been the standard format/medium used by computer monitors for some time.
  - To use this type, Sega provided a VGA adapter as an extra accessory.

Now, the Dreamcast can't encode all of these at the same time, so the GPU and the Audio processor contain a register called **Image Mode** that coordinates which required video/audio buses will be activated to generate the requested signal. The CPU detects which type of cable is inserted (by checking which select bits of the video connector are active) and writes the required values on the GPU, which will then be forwarded to the Audio processor.

Since VGA is strictly a progressive type of signal (as opposed to the traditional *interlaced*), some compatibility issues arose with games which were only designed for interlaced video. These explicitly state in their code that won't display on VGA, so the CPU will block the game until the user swaps out the VGA cable for another type.

#### Unified I/O Access

The GPU also includes another module for handling most of the I/O called **System Bus**. It provides the following interfaces:
- The **G1** interface: Where the **BIOS ROM** along with its saved configuration and the **GD-ROM** content can be accessed.
- The **G2** interface: Provides access to the **Modem** and **Sound Controller**.
- The **Maple** interface: Transfers chunks of data between the controllers (along with its accessories connected to it) and the CPU. It's a **serial bus** and provides a dedicated DMA.
- The **SH-4** interface: Connects the main CPU for general purpose communications.
- The **DDT** interface: Takes control of the CPU bus to access its main memory during DMA transfers.
- The **PVR** interface: Connects the CPU with the Tile Accelerator using a dedicated DMA.

## Audio

The Audio functionality is handled by a custom chip called **AICA** made by Yamaha, it's an improved version of the [}}#audio">SCSP used in the Saturn]({{< ref) and composed of four components:

- The **Sound Integrated Circuit** or 'IC': A set of modules (Synthesiser, DSP and Mixer) that generates the audio signal and applies effects on it. It supports up to 64 PCM channels with a resolution of 16 or 8 bits and a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz (overall, this is the optimal quality for playing audio).
  - Additionally, it includes an ADPCM decoder to offload some work from the CPU.
  - Curiously enough, it also includes two MIDI pins to connect a MIDI instrument, although this is meant to be used during development.
- **2 MB of SDRAM**: Stores sound data and programs. It can be filled by the main CPU using DMA.
- An **ARM7DI** running at ~2.82 MHz: Controls the Sound IC. This CPU is programmed by booting a small software stored in SRAM (sent by the main CPU) which will allow it to interpret the audio data and manipulate the Sound IC accordingly.
  - If you wonder, a similar CPU is also used [here]({{< ref "game-boy-advance">}}).
- **Memory Controller**: Interfaces the 2 MB of SDRAM.

#### Evolution

We've come so far since the days of the [}}#audio">Mega Drive/Genesis]({{< ref), in order to show how much progress was made in sound synthesis, here's an example of two games, one for the Mega Drive and the other for the Dreamcast, that used the same composition:

  </div>
{{< /side_by_side >}}

#### Staying alive

Somehow this chip is also responsible for providing a **Real Time Clock** or 'RTC' to the BIOS, it's also connected to a clock battery to continue working without AC power.

---

## Operating System

During the console's lifespan, there have been two different OS that could run on the Dreamcast:

#### Classic Shell

The 2 MB of 'System ROM' stores a **BIOS** that runs a small shell when the console is switched on.

{{< float_group >}}

{{< float_block >}}
  {{< linked_img src="shell.png" alt="Dreamcast Shell" >}} <figcaption class="caption">Shell after booting without a disc</figcaption>
{{< /float_block >}}

{{% inner_markdown %}}
It contains a simple graphical user interface to allow the user to perform basic but necessary tasks like:

- Start the game, if it hasn't already.
- Manipulate the save data stored in the VMU (more details about this device later!).
- Play music, if there's an Audio CD inserted.
- Change some settings (Date, Time, Sound, etc).

{{< /float_group >}}

#### Windows CE

Ever since the Dreamcast's announcement, it was said that it would run **Windows CE**: a stripped-down version of Windows designed for use on embedded devices. This may have misled users who may have expected to see a Windows CE desktop environment running on their console.

{{< float_group >}}
{{< float_block >}}
  {{< linked_img src="windows_ce.jpeg" alt="Windows CE" >}} <figcaption class="caption">Windows CE logo stamped on the front of the case</figcaption>
{{< /float_block >}}

{{% inner_markdown %}}
In reality, the purpose of this system was very similar to what Nintendo did with [}}#operating-system">the Nintendo 64]({{< ref): to provide programmers with a fair layer of abstraction to simplify certain operations.

Microsoft worked with Sega to bring Windows CE to the Dreamcast. The result was a subset of CE with the minimal components needed to provide graphics, audio, debugging, and compatibility with software like Microsoft's star IDE: *Visual Studio*.

Some developers found this very attractive. Since the audio-graphics framework included with CE was none other than **DirectX 6**, thousands of PC games of that era could, in theory, be easily ported to the Dreamcast...
{{% /inner_markdown %}}

{{< /float_group >}}

However, the architectural differences between the Dreamcast and the conventional PC were too great to ignore. Also, embedding this system increased the game's loading time (after all, the 'OS' had to be loaded from a disc) and Windows CE happened to eat a substantial part of resources from the Dreamcast (not surprisingly, PCs were already suffering from that).

In the end, Windows CE provided just another choice for developers to embed in their game. Nonetheless, a considerable number of Dreamcast games ended up being written using Windows APIs & DirectX.

---

## Games

Development was mainly done in **C** or **C++**: At first, C was the recommended choice since the available C++ compilers were initially very limited in functionality.

Sega also provided development hardware in the form of a PC-like tower called the **Sega Katana Development Box**. This is Dreamcast hardware with enhanced I/O for development. It also came with a CD containing the official **Katana SDK** that can be installed on a Windows PC.

In the case developers chose Windows CE as their main framework instead (by switching to **Dragon SDK**), they also had DirectX 6.0 and Visual C++ 6.0 available to make their games.

#### Medium

Games are stored in GD-ROMs, which are just CD-ROM with a higher density of pits (reaching a gigabyte of capacity). The speed is 12x which is not too shabby compared to the Saturn's 2x CD reader.

#### Online platform

Dreamcasts shipped with a **modem** module installed which games could use to 'call' a dial-up service for online gaming, Sega provided two services: **SegaNet** (used in America and Japan) and **Dreamarena** (the European counterpart).

Players had to first register with a service by using an extra disc that came with some games called **DreamKey**, it provided a web browser used to register an account. Initially, DreamKey came a pre-configured service depending on the region, later revisions allowed users to alter its ISP settings to connect to any of them.

There was also a dedicated Dreamcast branded keyboard and mouse available to buy, just in case the user fancied surfing the Internet like on a PC.

Unfortunately, SegaNet and Dreamarena were discontinued two years after launch, games that exclusively relied on them are unusable unless such services are emulated using extra tools (like the DreamPi, a Raspberry Pi image that replicates them with the help of some servers maintained by a community of users).

#### Interactive memory card

Another innovative feature that the Dreamcast included was the **Visual Memory Unit** or 'VMU'. It is attached to the controller and, aside from serving as a memory card, is a fully-fledged device that includes:

{{< /float_block >}}

{{% inner_markdown %}}
- A **Sanyo LC86K87**: An 8-bit low power CPU.
- A **32x48 Monochrome LCD** with four additional icons: Commanded using 196 B of XRAM (external RAM) as frame-buffer.
- **Two serial connectors**: One for IN and the other for OUT.
- **Six physical buttons**: Used when the VMU is detached from the controller.
- A **16 KB Mask-ROM**: Stores the BIOS-IPL.
- **64 KB of Flash**: 32 KB for storing a single program (transferred from the console) and the other 32 KB for keeping Dreamcast's saves.
- **512 B of RAM**: 256 B is reserved for the system, leaving only 256 B available for the program.
{{% /inner_markdown %}}

{{< /float_group >}}

The VMU has two modes of operation:

- **Attached to the controller**: The official controller has two slots to connect VMUs and other accessories with the same shape, if the VMU is inserted on the first slot (visible from the front of the controller), the VMU can display some drawings during gameplay. Moreover, the Dreamcast can store saves and a program on the VMU.
- **Detached from the controller**: The gadget becomes a Tamagotchi-like device with a clock, save manager and can also run whatever program the Dreamcast previously transferred. Two VMUs can be connected to share content as well.

## Anti-Piracy & Homebrew

Using the proprietary GD-ROM format helped to inhibit the production of unauthorised copies of games [and running them on other consoles]. Dreamcast games are also _region-locked_ meaning that a console will refuse to run a game intended for a different region.

#### Defeating it

In practice, the anti-piracy measures were *utterly* useless due to Sega leaving a huge backdoor open: **MIL-CD**. Music Interactive Live-CD or 'MIL-CD' is a format created by Sega to extend an Audio-CD with interactive programs... and the Dreamcast is compatible with it.

Now, someone [who?] discovered that after managing to rip the contents of a GD-ROM and modifying its format to adhere to the MIL-CD, burning it to a conventional CD and putting it in the Dreamcast would *just work*. This caused an unstoppable wave of burned discs and ISOs to be released on the net.

Some problems surfaced afterwards: Although GD-ROMs can store a gigabyte of data, CD-ROMs can only fit ~700 MB, so how could 'rippers' shrink the bigger games to fit on a CD? By re-compressing music and graphics until it fits. They may even try to split it into two discs. After all, game data is not a single blob anymore like on an old cartridge, but is now organised hierarchically into files and directories.
