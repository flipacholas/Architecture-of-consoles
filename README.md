This repo contains all the writings that constitute the [Architecture of Consoles](https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/) series. It has been made public to enable anyone to discuss improvements, add translations and possibly more.

This repo is structured as follows:
- 'articles' folder contain the writings in Markdown format, along with some front-matter (mainly meta-data) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) syntax (to generate special HTML).
    - Each file correspond to a specific console, except '_index' which corresponds to [this page](https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/).
- 'resources' contains a list of strings that are referenced across the site and are isolated for translation-purposes.
- 'changelog' keeps a log of changes of translated articles.

### Localisations

With all the traffic that's been going with the website I thought this would be an opportunity to enable any reader from anywhere in the world to help translate the content, helping to reach wider audiences.

If that's something you are interested, please check out the 'TRANSLATIONS.md' document.

### Corrections/Additions

Likewise, if you think there's a mistake (whether it's a technicality or involves multiple lines of text), please open an issue so we can discuss it. I don't recommend submitting a pull request right away since we may have a disagreement and I don't want you to waste your time! But I'm very open to any discussion.
