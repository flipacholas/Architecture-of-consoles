This repo contains all the writings that constitute the [Architecture of Consoles](https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/) series. It has been made public to enable anyone to discuss improvements, add translations and possibly more.

This repo is structured as follows:
- The 'articles' folder contains writings in Markdown format, along with some front-matter (mainly meta-data) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) syntax (to generate special HTML).
    - Each file corresponds to a specific console, except '_index' which corresponds to [this page](https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/).
- 'resources' contains a list of strings that are referenced across the site and are isolated for translation purposes.
- 'changelog' logs changes of translated articles.

### Localisations

With all the traffic that's been going to the website I thought this would be an opportunity to enable a reader from anywhere in the world to help translate the content, to help it to reach wider audiences.

If that's something you are interested in, please check out the 'TRANSLATIONS.md' document.

### Corrections/Additions

Likewise, if you think there's a mistake (whether it's a technicality or involves multiple lines of text), please open an issue so we can discuss it. I don't recommend submitting a pull request right away since we may have a disagreement and I don't want you to waste your time! But I'm very open to any discussion.
