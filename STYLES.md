## Architecture of Consoles Style Sheet (beta)

#### Acronym Expanded Form (AEF)

This is regarded as the best way to expand an initialism or acronym. The first occurence of uncommon acronyms in each article should be explained in this way. (Common acronyms (like CPU) are assumed to be understood by the reader.)

#### Using 'ise'-type British spellings. No capital after colon.

#### Vocabulary

'Writings' - this is an unusual word but it is acceptable, I will not change it as you use it very frequently and have integrated it into your site structure. I consider it part of your voice (from your name I'm guessing there is some Italian/ESL going on, but I could be wrong).

"on the fly" – I took the hyphens out of that and another construction in the same paragraph, while adding them in for "in-step"

Using 'waveforms' as it's a common enough word nowadays to drop the hyphen.

"However" typically has a comma after it – use without a comma is common, but recommended against by the editing community (which is a little more resistant to change than the tech community, as you might imagine). There is a good reason in theory: it's to distinguish between uses like

> However, they survived ("But they survived")

and

> However they survived ("They survived, but we don't know how, and we're about to talk about something else").

#### Capitalisation - nouns vs proper nouns

Making sure to appy capitalisation to proper nouns only.
